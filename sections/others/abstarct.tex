This project develops a web application for the centralized management of multiple marketplaces, conceived as a powerful automation tool and a unified method to optimize e-commerce operations. The e-commerce sector, which is constantly growing, faces significant challenges such as an strong competition, the complexity of technological and logistical infrastructure, and the high costs associated with managing products, orders, and payments across various sales channels, raditionally consuming valuable time and resources.

To overcome these obstacles and seize the opportunities of online commerce, the proposed solution acts as a strategic and centralized method for efficiently managing sales channels. Its main goal is to centralize information and the management of orders and products from different marketplaces into a single platform, offering a unified view of the business.

This solution represents a first functional version that lays the groundwork for what could, in the future, evolve into a comprehensive multichannel management platform, capable of scaling, adapting to new marketplaces, and providing advanced tools for analysis, automation, and decision-making for e-commerce businesses.
